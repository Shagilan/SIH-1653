## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Key Features1. Virtual Boardroom Experience
1.A web-based simulation of an interview room where candidates face expert panelists in a structured format.
Supports live and AI-driven interviews with automated assessment.

2. AI-Powered Questioning & Evaluation
Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate relevant questions based on the applicant's domain expertise.
Ice-breaking → Techno-managerial → In-depth discussions structured for fairness.
AI evaluates response relevance and technical accuracy.

3. Scoring & Unbiased Assessment
Automated real-time scoring system for:
Question relevancy to expertise.
Response relevancy to the question.
Overall subject knowledge & suitability for the role.
Helps minimize human bias in evaluations.

4. Multi-user Role Management
Interviewers: Ask questions & review scores.
Candidates: Provide responses & get feedback.
Admins: Manage interviews, track analytics, and improve hiring efficiency.

5. Tech Stack Recommendations
Frontend: React.js / Angular.
Backend: Django / Node.js.
AI/NLP: GPT-based models for question generation & response analysis.
Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB.
Video Conferencing: WebRTC / Jitsi.
